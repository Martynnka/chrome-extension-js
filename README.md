# 🔗 Save Links – Chrome Extension

A simple and clean Chrome extension built while learning modern JavaScript fundamentals.

This app allows users to quickly save links manually or directly from the current browser tab, store them in localStorage, and manage them efficiently.

## 🧠 What I Practiced & Learned

This project helped me understand and apply:

- `const` and variable management
- `addEventListener()` for user interaction
- `innerHTML` for rendering dynamic content
- `input.value` handling
- Function parameters
- Template strings (`` `...${value}...` ``)
- `localStorage` for persistent data
- The `JSON` object (`JSON.stringify()` / `JSON.parse()`)
- Working with objects inside arrays
